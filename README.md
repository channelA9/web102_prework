## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My biggest issue was trying to comprehend some of the unique functions like reduce and filter. I also had some issues trying to understand how to deconstruct some
variables since I was working with an object type and didn't realize they had to match variable names.

Beyond that, the remaining challenge was just refreshing my knowledge of JS since it had been a long time since I last used it. I was able to re-familiarize myself with the syntax fairly quickly.
